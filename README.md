## MECAZON
One of the biggest projects we've ever tackled in the West-Mec Coding technical program was MECAZON. Instead of this being an individual project that each student completed solo, it was a class-wide team effort. The project was meant to mimmick the feeling of being in a professional environment and working within a team of about fifteen or sixteen developers to complete one website.
